# city-health

This code provides a delivery distance calculation mechanism considering various factors such as order volume, courier availability, and weather conditions. The primary goal is to dynamically adjust the delivery radius based on specific conditions, optimizing the delivery process.

Functionality
calculate_delivery_distance
This function calculates the optimal delivery distance based on the following parameters:

order_amount: The total number of orders.
couriers_percentage: The percentage of available couriers.
orders_per_courier: The average number of orders assigned to each courier.
minutes_below_threshold: The duration below the minimum orders per courier threshold.
city: The city for which the delivery distance is calculated.
region: The region within the city (currently not used).
is_global_tech_emergency: Flag for a global technical emergency.
optimizer_stops_assigning: Flag indicating if the optimizer has stopped assigning orders.
City-Specific Parameters
The delivery distance calculation is city-specific, with parameters stored in the city_params dictionary. Each city has its own set of triggers and thresholds for adjusting the delivery radius.

Weather Conditions
The code utilizes an external API (Deutscher Wetterdienst) to fetch weather warning levels for a given city. Based on the warning level, the handle_weather_conditions function adjusts the delivery radius accordingly.

Usage
To use the provided functions, import them as follows:

python
Copy code
from delivery_distance_calculator import calculate_delivery_distance
from weather_conditions import get_weather_warning_level, handle_weather_conditions
Then, set up the necessary input parameters and call the functions:

python
Copy code
# Example usage:
order_amount = 100
couriers_percentage = 60
orders_per_courier = 3.2
minutes_below_threshold = 35
city = "Berlin"
region = "East"
is_global_tech_emergency = False
optimizer_stops_assigning = False

# Calculate delivery distance
current_radius = calculate_delivery_distance(order_amount, couriers_percentage, orders_per_courier, minutes_below_threshold, city, region, is_global_tech_emergency, optimizer_stops_assigning)

# Fetch weather warning level
warning_level = get_weather_warning_level(city)

# Handle weather conditions
new_radius = handle_weather_conditions(city, warning_level, current_radius)

print(f"The calculated delivery distance with weather conditions is {new_radius} meters.")
Dependencies
The code relies on the requests library for fetching weather data from the Deutscher Wetterdienst API. Ensure that the library is installed in your environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests
Notes
The weather API key should be replaced with a valid one from Deutscher Wetterdienst for accurate weather data retrieval.
City-specific parameters may need adjustments based on real-world data and optimization requirements.
Feel free to customize the code and parameters to suit specific use cases and enhance the delivery distance optimization process.
